Last year’s ROG Azoth was a massive hit, and now ROG has pushed the boundaries of mass production with the Azoth Extreme. Let me be clear: this is the best-sounding stock keyboard I've ever heard! The exterior showcases obsessive craftsmanship—from the deep-gray, fingerprint-resistant anodization to the complex, multi-layered CNC bottom case that brings the keyboard to a dense 1.5 kilograms for a deeper acoustic profile. It features a smaller, color, touch-enabled OLED screen and maintains the convenient 75% layout with spaced F-keys. Internally, ROG has introduced a revolutionary adjustable internal hardness structure, allowing you to fine-tune the feel from soft to hard, complete with a Carbon Fiber plate and built-in force-break pads to eliminate resonance. This sound is rich and satisfying, thanks to the quality build and the excellent ROG Snow switches. Furthermore, it boasts the unique 8000Hz wireless polling rate—a true display of force—with astonishing 127-hour battery life, achieved through an ingenious antenna design cleverly integrated into the metal trim. While the price is high, what you are buying is unparalleled surface quality, an extremely stable body, and ROG’s top-tier wireless performance, all wrapped into a flagship mechanical experience that effortlessly combines luxury, comfort, and gaming performance.
