We are about to unbox what might be the most cost-effective ROG tri-mode wireless gaming headset of 2025! Let's go!
This is the ROG Pelta. Its exterior features a more modern, textured aesthetic, but look closely: the earcup has a diagonal line sliced through the middle, with the iconic ROG 'Eye of Guts' logo carved underneath. It's telling you: "I'm still the gaming headset you know and trust." It weighs only 309 grams, which is incredibly light. It boasts a three-stage adjustable elastic headband and breathable mesh ear cushions, emphasizing maximum wearing comfort.
You can use the Armoury Crate control software to switch between Music Mode, Movie Mode, Gaming Mode, and more. In Music Mode, vocals are clearer and the bass immersion is stronger, and you can even activate virtual surround sound for an excellent sense of space. But let's talk about the FPS Shooting Mode: you’ll hear significantly highlighted footsteps and suppressed gunshots—no muddiness, no piercing blasts—allowing you to easily pinpoint the enemy's exact location. Even if you can't outgun them, at least you can out-equip them!
For a price of $4590 NTD (or relevant local currency), you get ultra-low-latency tri-mode wireless connectivity, large 50mm titanium-plated diaphragm drivers, an incredible 70-hour long battery life, and a detachable, AI Noise-Canceling super-wideband microphone. And the key selling point: it's an ROG! Honestly, I'd be hard-pressed to find any competitors in this price range.
