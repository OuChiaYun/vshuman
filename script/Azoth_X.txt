The ROG Azoth is back and better. This is the new ROG Azoth X, and while it looks like a fun keycap swap with this cool red, black, and white interstellar theme, the biggest changes are under the hood!
First, the aesthetics are top-tier. The white aluminum top case uses electrophoretic coating—it’s clean, it’s durable, and it’s beautiful. It keeps the classic 75% layout, but now you can manage all your settings via the super-fast Gear Link web-based driver—no more clunky software needed!
But let's talk about the experience. The typing feel and sound are fantastic, thanks to some key updates. It features all-new NX Snow V2 linear switches with the best factory lube job I’ve ever seen on a mass-produced MX switch—they are incredibly smooth and crisp. Internally, ROG swapped the plate to FR4 and uses a complex stacking of Poron and silicone foams. The sound is satisfyingly thick, clean, and consistent right out of the box.
And because it’s ROG, the performance is unmatched. It supports Tri-Mode connectivity and maintains ROG’s legendary SpeedNova wireless stability, with an astonishing 1600-hour battery life with lights off. Plus, they’ve even improved the internals to be easier to disassemble if you want to swap out the new, standard plate-mounted stabilizers.
The Azoth X is a near-perfect blend of custom keyboard sound and feel, packaged with ROG’s top-tier wireless tech. If you want a premium, high-performance 75% keyboard that you can truly mod or just use as-is, the Azoth X is it!
