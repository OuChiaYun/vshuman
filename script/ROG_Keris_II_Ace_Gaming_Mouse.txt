Wow! That triple-zone RGB lighting is so cool! And hey, at 65 grams, it's pretty light! Plus, this is an ergonomic mouse. Wait a minute—I remember you're a claw or palm grip player, right?
Look at the right side of the exterior, this extended edge is specifically designed for your ring finger, giving you a comfortable contour to rest it on. This lets you focus more on your index and middle fingers. Tap firing, short bursts, spray control, aiming down sights—everything is super flexible.
The mouse body is designed to tuck in, making it easy to grip the mouse. For lifters, it helps you better gauge the force needed to pick up and set down the mouse. The middle section of the mouse is quite high, which provides extra support for palm-grip players. Basically, the best thing about an ergonomic mouse is that it lets you relax, relax, and just relax!
Now, let's talk about the feel of the main left and right buttons. The click sound is crisp, the actuation force is light, and the overall feel is light with even pressure distribution. The coating is different from the main body—it has a rough, granular texture that isn't sticky or slippery. People who get sweaty hands, like me, will probably love this. The side buttons have a crisp feel at the front and a slightly deeper thud at the back, with a noticeable tactile break. The scroll wheel is heavy to turn, but the press click has clear confirmation.
Wait, wait, wait... Why aren't you using a mouse pad? Have you heard of glass tracking technology? It can detect motion on nearly any surface!
Check this out, using the web-based driver, everything you need to adjust is right here. Of course, we have to adjust that awesome RGB first, right?
Alright, it’s time to hit you with the specs! The left and right buttons are rated for 100 million clicks. Want to swap the micro switches? No problem—you can do it in about 3 minutes. It features tri-mode wireless connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, and Wired. Whether wired or wireless, by utilizing this polling rate accelerator, the polling rate can reach a maximum of 8000Hz, and the maximum speed comes in at 750 IPS. With the lights off, the 2.4GHz battery life goes up to 127 hours.
