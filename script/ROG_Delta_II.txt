The legendary ROG Delta is back with the upgrade we’ve all been waiting for: the ROG Delta II Tri-Mode Wireless Headset! Forget the old version—this one has everything.
First, the looks: it features a sleek, premium design with new metal hinges, and yes, it finally has the dazzling RGB ROG logo on the D-shaped earcups!
Next, the performance is effortless. It offers Tri-Mode connectivity (Wired, Bluetooth, 2.4GHz), and thanks to ROG's SpeedNova Wireless Technology, you get an ultra-low-latency, super-stable connection for competitive gaming, plus a huge 110-hour battery life in 2.4GHz mode.
But here is the killer feature: DualFlow Audio. You can connect to your PC via 2.4GHz and your phone via Bluetooth simultaneously, allowing you to mix game audio and phone music or calls at the same time—no more fumbling to switch devices! With 50mm Titanium-Plated Drivers delivering clear, detailed sound, the ROG Delta II is the ultimate flexible audio solution for every gamer.
