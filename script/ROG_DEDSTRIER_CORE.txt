Many of you have been asking in the stream chat what chair I’m sitting on, so today, I’m finally revealing my new secret weapon: the ROG DESTRIER CORE Gaming Chair! Specifically, I chose the crisp white version this time.
When it comes to a chair, which do you think is more important: comfort or aesthetics? I think... well, as adults, we should absolutely have both!
Let's take a look at the design. It's incredibly stylish, available in both black and white. The overall look is very well-designed—you see, just sitting in it makes you feel like, "Wow, this person must be great at Valorant, right?" It gives you that confident, pro-player swagger!
I also want to share my experience after using it for the past few days: the comfort is amazing! Because of my lifestyle, I spend a lot of time sitting, and poor seating easily leads to back aches. This chair allows me to adjust my posture to my personal habits anytime: the backrest reclines up to 125 degrees, the armrests can rotate 360 degrees, and they can also be raised up to 14 centimeters.
The seat material is an ergonomic, breathable mesh, which means you won't sweat easily during long sessions—no more worrying about feeling sticky or hot, even in the summer!
And there’s one small but important detail: ROG was very thoughtful about the needs of competitive gamers. The casters are specially designed with silent materials. This way, when we’re gaming late into the night or watching competitions, we don't have to worry about the sliding noise disturbing the downstairs neighbors!
So, the high-value ROG DESTRIER CORE, which delivers on both comfort and style, is my recommendation to all of you. You can choose based on your personal needs and preferences. If you have a slightly larger budget, you might also consider the advanced version, the ROG DESTRIER ERGO. If you're really undecided, you can always visit an ROG retail store to try them out across Taiwan—there’s definitely one that's right for you!
